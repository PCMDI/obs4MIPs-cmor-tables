## obs4MIPs-cmor-tables ##

This repo is used to develop and maintain:

- Version control of **obs4MIPs compliant [`source_ids`](https://github.com/PCMDI/obs4MIPs-cmor-tables/blob/master/obs4MIPs_source_id.json)** 
- Maintenance of [obs4MIPs CMOR tables (json files)](https://github.com/PCMDI/obs4MIPs-cmor-tables/tree/master/Tables)
- Version controlled documentation of processing codes to used to prepare obs4MIPs compliant data
- Selected demos for perparing obs4MIPs compliant data
- Up-to-date obs4MIPs Controlled Vocabularies (CVs; json files) including: 
    - `source_id`
    - `nominal_resolution`
    - `frequency`
    - many other `required_global_attributes` 

## Implementation of new source_ids 

To propose a new `source_id`, [open an issue in this repo](https://github.com/PCMDI/obs4MIPs-cmor-tables/issues/new/choose). When submitting an issue, a template is provided for contributors to modify for their proposed `source_id`. Once the issue is submitted, one of the site maintainers will review it and when ready will execute its implementation into the database of `source_ids` maintained within the [`obs4MIPs_source_id.json`](https://github.com/PCMDI/obs4MIPs-cmor-tables/blob/master/obs4MIPs_source_id.json) file in this repo.
