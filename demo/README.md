This demo must be run with CMOR 3.2.6 or a more recent version.  CMOR can be obtained via Anaconda at https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cmor once the user has installed Anaconda (https://continuum.io).  More information about CMOR is available at: https://cmor.llnl.gov

This demo uses xarray to read the demo data before sending it to CMOR.
