This demo must be run with CMOR 3.2.6 or a more recent version.  CMOR can be obtained via Anaconda at https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cmor once the user has installed Anaconda (https://continuum.io).  More information about CMOR is available at: https://cmor.llnl.gov

The current demo uses xarray to read the demo data before sending it to CMOR.   


Demos will also be provide here using software other than CDMS2, e.g., xcdat, xarray, and IRIS. 

[More details on the process of preparing obs4MIPs compliant data are available](https://github.com/PCMDI/obs4MIPs-cmor-tables/tree/master/inputs/README.md)
